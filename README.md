## Status

This project contains experimental code developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Tooling team. As of 10 March 2025, this code is available for internal ASF feedback only.

This codebase is in early development and subject to significant changes. We welcome feedback but recommend focusing on architectural and design aspects rather than implementation details. Many known issues, especially regarding implementation details, are already scheduled for improvement. Documentation and code quality will be enhanced incrementally.

This repository is not yet part of any officially maintained or supported ASF project. It does not represent final technical decisions for future ASF Tooling products.

The code is provided without guarantees regarding stability, security, or backward compatibility.

## Purpose

This code is intended to one day help ASF Tooling to test internal ideas for the [Apache Trusted Release](https://github.com/apache/tooling-docs/blob/main/apache-trusted-release/requirements.md) platform.
